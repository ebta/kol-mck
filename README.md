# KOL - MCK
> This repository is for archiving purposes. KOL development was stopped in 2015, modifications are minimized, and new version will appear very rare.

## Introduction
KOL (Key Objects Library) it self is a set of objects to develop power (but small) 32 bit Windows GUI applications using Delphi but without VCL (or Free Pascal). KOL allows to create executables of size about 10-20 times smaller than regular Delphi 7.

## Brief description
Delphi2 - Delphi7, Borland Developer Studio 2005-2012, Turbo-Delphi, Kylix and Free Pascal Compiler 1.0.5 and higher are supported. KOL allows to create very compact Windows32 GUI applications (starting from ~11K without compression - if suggested system units replacement used). The most of code is converted to built-in assembler.

A help generating tool **xHelpGen** is provided for KOL, which creates detailed documentation in html format. Documentation is generated on base of comments from the source, so developers instantly have access to the most fresh and complete documentation.

**MCK** (Mirror Classes Kit) is a package provided with KOL, so that all the advantages of visual programming are available for Delphi developers who use KOL. MCK is just like VCL for KOL
